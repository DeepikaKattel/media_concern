                The Media Concern Nepal (MCN) is an autonomous non-profitable, non-political, non-governmental development organization. It was established in December 2005 with the initiation of highly self-motivated and dynamic youths dedicated to contribute in development of marginalized and vulnerable communities in rural and remote areas of Nepal. The ultimate aim of the MCN is to contribute in sustainable development of the rural communities specially women, children and marginalized communities by mobilizing the human and natural resources, promoting appropriate indigenous knowledge in collaboration with different development actors both at national and international level.<br><br>
MCN is enriched in production of education, awareness raising and media campaign materials mostly video documentaries and disseminating them as right based development means in the areas of maternal and reproductive health, womenâ€™s right, children, nutrition, livelihoods, food security, natural resource management and tourism. Further, MCN is concentrating on the documentation and dissemination of current socio-economic development issues of the country and lobbying for better policies and programs. It has been executing the programs in close collaboration with national development partners like government line agencies, civil society and human rights organizations.<br><br>
For the first Nine years (2005-2013) of its growth and development, MCN mainly involved in developing visual media such as producing video documentary, media campaigning, educating and awareness raising  to improve maternal and reproductive health, livelihoods of rural women and vulnerable communities, HIV/AIDs, natural resource management and all these is contributing to address the  burning issues of Nepal. Its past experiences working in these field have been highly valuable to enhance its work further on action oriented activities such as action researches, policy advocacy, trainings, good governance and empowerment of particularly the rural women, ethnic minorities, conflict affected communities and in general very poor people of Nepal. Now, rural development interventions have become further strategies in addition to media campaigning, education and awareness raising.
