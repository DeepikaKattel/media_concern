                The majority of rural smallholder farmers and women remain dependent on natural resources for their food security and declining resource productivity is of primary importance for them. Similarly, the rural communities are increasingly turning to natural resources to maintain their livelihoods. Hence, there are strong linkages between NRM and livelihood security. As people use natural resources beyond a sustainable level, their livelihoods will in turn be threatened. Ultimately, natural resource degradation will destroy rural livelihoods and economies. Therefore, MCN emphasizes the promotion of natural resource management activities which meets the basic needs and livelihoods of rural poor, women and all vulnerable groups and communities in Nepal.

                Research and public policy have not received adequate attention in Nepal. As Nepal passing through a long and difficult political transition which has been affecting for good governance, appropriate programs and activities to respond the needs of poor and vulnerable communities who occupies majorities of population in Nepal. So, there is an even greater need for action researches as reliable knowledge generation for public policies to the urgent needs of poor and marginalized communities. Action researches and its findings are instrumental for policy advocacy, campaigns as need and interest of marginalized people. Hence, MCN, conducts action researches and engage to change, formulate the alternative policies in favor of deprived and disadvantaged ones who are rural women, children, ethnic minorities and poor.
